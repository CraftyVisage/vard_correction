Calculates correction to the upper bound using blocked trajectory data. Uses
the scaled cumulant generating function representation to get this correction
as described in:

Jacobson, D. & Whitelam, S. Direct evaluation of dynamical large-deviation
rate functions using a variational ansatz. Phys. Rev. E 100, 052139 (2019).

See --input command line argument. Data formatting is two columns. First
column is the intensive observable minus the mean value, a - a_0. The second
column is the intensive log likelihood ratio minus the mean, q - q_0.

estimators. Phys. Rev. E 92, 052104 (2015).
